# Capstone_Spark_Project

## Project Motivation

This project is from Udacity's capstone project. The dataset of this project is from a music app SParkify, including the basic 
user information and actions on music.  This project aims to use spark to predict churned users based on the dataset and deploy the solution on a distributed system for large dataset.

## Project Procedures

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Exploration
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling and Prediction

## Project Results

This project uses four machine learning models logistic regression, random forest, decision tree and GBT with different hyperparameters The best model is logistic regression (with AUC score 0.73)
